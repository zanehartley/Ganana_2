This is an unsupervised domain adaptation network for 3D reconstruction 
from a single image using a Volumetric Regression Network (VRN). This 
method approaches the problem of reconstruction as a segmentation problem, 
producing a 3D volume, spatially aligned with the input image. A mesh can then be
obtained by taking the isosurface of this volume.

/Please note, this repo is currently a work in progress.  Code used has been provided, but further work to improve usability still needs to be carried out. We appreciate your patience./

** Software Requirements

A working installation of Pytorch is required. This can be easily
installed on most platforms from [[https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/][the Pytorch website]]. You will also require
a reasonable CUDA capable GPU.

Quick overview of requirements:

- Pytorch (+ nn, cunn, cudnn, image).
- NVIDIA GPU, with a working CUDA and CuDNN.

Please be wary of the version numbers for CUDA, CuDNN and Python.

** Getting Started

*** Running with Python

*** Available Options
